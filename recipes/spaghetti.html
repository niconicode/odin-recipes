            <ol>
                <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees Farenheit or 175 degrees Celsius.
                </li>
                <li>
                Bring large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water
                until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 to 12 minutes. Drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                While pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir 
                beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutres. Drain and discard grease.
                </li>
                <li>
                Transfer beef to a bowl and mix in spaghetti sauce.
                </li>
                <li>
                Place half of the butter slices into the bottom of a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Spread half
                of the spaghetti into the dish.
                </li>
                <li>
                Mix cottage cheese, cream cheese, and sour cream together in a bowl. Spread mixture over spaghetti.
                </li>
                <li>
                Cover with remaining spaghetti and top with remaining slices of butter.
                </li>
                <li>
                Pour ground beef mixture over spaghetti and spread in even layer.
                </li>
                <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. Spread cheddar cheese on top and continue baking until
                cheese has melted and is lightly browned, about 15 minutes more. Then Serve.
